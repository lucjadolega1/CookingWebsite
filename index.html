		<br><br>
		Let's start with some interesting things like How did I start cooking?
		Hmm. The story isn't long. I started cooking during the covid-19 stay at home 
		time. I had a lot of free time and I used it to practice my cooking skills. I can't call 
		myself a chef but I think I make tasty dinners and my boyfriend doesn't complain.
		<br><br>
		You might be wondering if I continue cooking. The answer is yes but not as often as before.
	</p>
	
	<p class="continuedintro">Many of you might have a different idea of cooking. Some cook because they have to and some 
		to relax or have fun. When I cook, I like to experiment. I mean, I like changing some ingredients or putting less amounts.
		I rarely save the recipes. I look at the recipes online and then just take a picture of what I done (including some prepared ingredients).
		It may seem crazy, but you know what? It always tastes great!
